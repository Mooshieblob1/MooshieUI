## What's New in v0.4.1

### Black Image Fix (NaN Guard)
- Fixed a critical issue where generated images could come out **entirely black** due to NaN (Not-a-Number) values in the VAE output tensor
- Root cause: fp16 VAE decode overflow under VRAM pressure (especially with WanVAE and large batches) produces NaN values that `np.clip()` cannot catch
- Added `np.nan_to_num()` guards in all three image encoding paths:
  - **MooshieFaceDetailer**: input image frames are now sanitized before face detection
  - **MooshieSaveImage (8-bit PNG)**: output tensor is checked and clamped before uint8 conversion
  - **MooshieSaveImage (16-bit PNG)**: `_encode_16bit()` sanitizes before the 65535 multiply
- When NaN values are detected, a warning is printed to the ComfyUI log identifying the affected batch index

### Automatic BF16 VAE for Blackwell GPUs
- MooshieUI now **auto-detects NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs** (compute capability ≥ 12.0) at launch and automatically applies `--bf16-vae` to ComfyUI
- BFloat16 VAE uses the same exponent range as fp32 (preventing overflow/NaN) at half the VRAM cost — the best of both worlds
- This prevents the fp16 VAE overflow that causes black images in the first place, without the VRAM penalty of `--fp32-vae`
- Detection uses `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap` — silently skipped if nvidia-smi is unavailable (e.g. AMD/Intel GPUs)
- **User override**: if you've manually set any VAE precision flag (`--bf16-vae`, `--fp16-vae`, `--fp32-vae`, `--cpu-vae`) in Settings > Extra Args, the auto-detection is skipped
